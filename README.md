# Email-and-Website-validations

Lab02 is not that much of dynamic as the email works for only gmail otherwise it will give invalid mail
the file.java is dynamic any mail can be validate with it
input file is the mail file which will be read 
it will take one integer value by which we can determine how many line needs to be execute.
